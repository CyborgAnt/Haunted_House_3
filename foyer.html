        <p>You step through the front door and enter a modest - for a Mansion - Foyer.</p>
        <p>There is a closet to your left, with various jackets and coats hanging in there. <br>There are some standing coat racks along the wall, next to the closet. Along the walls of the foyer are small framed pieces of artwork, depicting "bright" things such as a sunrise, tulips, and meadows. <br>There is a small table, to the left of the doorway, but there is nothing of interest on it.</p>
        <p>There is an entryway or short hallway to the left of the closet. <br>To the right of the doorway you entered the Mansion through, there is a set of stairs leading down. <br>There is also a hall that opens up into a much larger room, next to the stairs.
