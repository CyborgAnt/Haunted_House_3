        <p>You step through the front door and enter a modest - for a Mansion - Foyer.</p>
        <p>There is a closet to your left, with various jackets and coats hanging in there. There are some standing coat racks along the wall, next to the closet. Along the walls of the foyer are small framed pieces of artwork, depicting "bright" things such as a sunrise, tulips, and meadows. There is a small table, to the left of the doorway, but there is nothing of interest on it.</p>
        <p>There is an entryway or short hallway to the left of the closet. To the right of the doorway you entered the Mansion through, there is a set of stairs leading down. There is also a hall that opens up into a much larger room.
